# Write a program that encrypts a given string using the Caesar cipher, 
# which is a special case of a mono-alphabetic substitution cipher. 
# The program retrieves the text to be encrypted from the user 
# and the number n by which the alphabet is moved by which the text is encrypted, 
# and then prints the encrypted text in the console. For simplicity, 
# it can be assumed that the input string consists only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, i.e. 'a' - 'z' and spaces.

# Example a: text: alice has a cat, n: 1, result: bmjdf ibt b dbu

# Example b: text: alice has a cat, n: 26, result: alice has a cat

# Get data from the user in the console using argument-less input().
